Hello! Thank you for using Coco X4, to open Coco X4, please open Cache, then open CocoX4 Folder.

P.S 

Sona, i know you're watching my Discord server, i know you have a spy because they
brought Stella_Yao in once i announced Sona was working on Coco X4. And i like to
say that Sona on Coco X4 is only there because i wanted a few APIs for Coco, i
wanted to improve the compatibility of Coco, and because all of the APIs i found
were not updated or shat, i asked Vegie.

Your DLL became Vegie's money maker because you didn't attempt to make amends with Vegie,
you just decided to shun him away, and make him the enemy, when all he wants to do is
benefit the skids, and make some money for his college fund.
