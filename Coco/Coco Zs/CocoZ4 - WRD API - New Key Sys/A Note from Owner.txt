Hello, it's one of the Coco Z owners, N4ri.

I decided to write a little note for you, because i know some of you have trouble using Coco Z.

If this is your first time using any exploit, i highly suggest running the CocoStrapper, this downloads Coco Z
for you, sure, but it does many other things, like Excluding Coco Z from Windows Defender, and install some
libraries so Coco can work out of the box, Thank Wabz for making this.

There is also a CocoStrapper tutorial avaliable Thanks to Darkn:

If Coco has issues injecting, try installing these 2 things:
Microsoft Visual C++ x86: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
Microsoft Visual C++ x64: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

Note that Extreme Injector won't work, because for some unknown reason, it only works on one injector, 
Puppy Milk Injector.

If you are confused on using Coco Z, you can refer to our Instructions Manual:
https://cocotechnology.tech/instructions.pdf

If you are Deleting Coco Z, and are having issues, it's most likely that Coco Z is running in the background,
do not worry, we aren't doing anything malicious, it's just that Coco Z is at an unoptimized state currently.
To fix this, go find Coco Z in your Task Manager, and end the task.

If you cannot resolve your issues, go to our discord server and get some help, thought our support
may be incompetent, if so, you can contact me, but i am not always free to help, and you may not
annoy me to help you, i will most likely ban you.

Do NOT DM MCGamin1738, he is not welcome to greet anyone and will ban you, he is too busy to develop to help you.

If you have any complaints about the current support team, please DM me and i will take it into consideration.
