I'll be honest here, i'm just a designer, not a developer, this means that I only worked on the creative aspects of Mercury (aka weird design choices and logo) so most of the code in Mercury isn't mines, it's from a shit ton of google searches and from some friends and people in this community
Call me a skid whatever you want, but at least I take the time to give credit to people whenever, and I don't pretend to be a C# dev unlike some people.
